# Entity Framework Change Tracker

## What is the Change Tracker?

The **Change Tracker** in Entity Framework Core is a mechanism that tracks changes made to entities in your context. It identifies which entities have been:
- Added
- Modified
- Deleted

These changes are used to generate SQL commands that are executed during the `SaveChanges()` method call.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Entity States**
Each entity tracked by the Change Tracker is assigned a state:
- **Added:** The entity is new and will be inserted into the database.
- **Modified:** The entity's values have been updated, and changes will be saved to the database.
- **Deleted:** The entity is marked for removal and will be deleted from the database.
- **Unchanged:** The entity's values are the same as those in the database; no action will be taken.

### 2. **Tracking Changes**
The Change Tracker works by:
- Monitoring changes to entity properties.
- Detecting when new entities are added or removed.
- Comparing the current state of the entity with its original state (as retrieved from the database).

---

## Key Properties and Methods

### 1. **`ChangeTracker.Entries`**
Retrieves all entities currently tracked:
```csharp
var trackedEntities = context.ChangeTracker.Entries();
foreach (var entry in trackedEntities)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Entity: {entry.Entity.GetType().Name}, State: {entry.State}");
}
```

### 2. **`EntityEntry.State`**
Indicates the current state of an entity:
```csharp
var entry = context.Entry(someEntity);
entry.State = EntityState.Modified; // Manually set state
```

### 3. **`DetectChanges()`**
Manually forces the Change Tracker to detect changes:
```csharp
context.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges();
```
> Note: EF Core calls this method automatically before `SaveChanges()`.

### 4. **`AutoDetectChangesEnabled`**
To improve performance, you can disable automatic change detection:
```csharp
context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;
```
> This is useful for bulk operations.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Check Tracked Entities**
You can inspect which entities are being tracked:
```csharp
var entries = context.ChangeTracker.Entries();
foreach (var entry in entries)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Entity: {entry.Entity.GetType().Name}, State: {entry.State}");
}
```

### 2. **Reset Changes**
You can reset changes to an entity:
```csharp
context.Entry(entity).Reload();
```

### 3. **Manually Set Entity State**
If EF doesn’t detect changes automatically:
```csharp
context.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Modified;
```

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Disable Auto-Tracking for Read-Only Queries**
   - Use `.AsNoTracking()` for queries where you don't need to track changes.
   ```csharp
   var products = context.Products.AsNoTracking().ToList();
   ```

2. **Disable Auto-Detect Changes for Bulk Operations**
   - Temporarily disable change detection:
   ```csharp
   context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;
   ```

3. **Minimize Tracked Entities**
   - Only track entities that are actively modified.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use `AsNoTracking` for Performance**  
   Read-only queries benefit significantly from disabling tracking:
   ```csharp
   var orders = context.Orders.AsNoTracking().ToList();
   ```

2. **Explicitly Set States**  
   When working with detached entities, explicitly set the state:
   ```csharp
   context.Entry(order).State = EntityState.Modified;
   ```

3. **Audit Entity Changes**  
   Use the Change Tracker to log or audit changes before saving:
   ```csharp
   var changes = context.ChangeTracker.Entries()
       .Where(e => e.State == EntityState.Modified);
   foreach (var change in changes)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Entity {change.Entity.GetType().Name} has been modified.");
   }
   ```

## **Tracking vs. AsNoTracking**

### **Tracking**

By default, Entity Framework Core tracks entities as they are retrieved from the database. This allows you to easily modify entities and have those changes automatically detected and persisted when `SaveChanges()` is called.

- **When to Use Tracking:**
  - When you need to modify entities after they are retrieved from the database.
  - When you want EF to automatically detect and save changes.
  - For scenarios where data updates need to be tracked for consistency.

```csharp
var products = context.Products.ToList(); // Tracking is enabled by default
```

### **AsNoTracking**

`AsNoTracking()` is used when you don't need to modify the data retrieved from the database. It improves performance by not tracking entities, meaning that EF Core does not keep track of changes, which is useful for read-only operations.

- **When to Use AsNoTracking:**
  - When you only need to query the data without modifying it.
  - For performance optimization, especially in large queries or reports.
  - When you want to avoid unnecessary tracking overhead in scenarios where data will not be modified.

```csharp
var products = context.Products.AsNoTracking().ToList(); // No tracking, faster for read-only queries
```

## Summary

The Change Tracker is a powerful feature in Entity Framework Core, helping to manage and persist entity changes to the database. By understanding how it works and how to control it, you can:
- Improve performance.
- Debug issues with entity state management.
- Audit and customize entity changes.

Key methods to remember:
- `DetectChanges()`
- `Entries()`
- `AutoDetectChangesEnabled`
- `AsNoTracking()`

Use the Change Tracker wisely to maintain control over your application's database interactions.
